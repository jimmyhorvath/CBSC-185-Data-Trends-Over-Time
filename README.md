# CBSC-185-Data-Trends-Over-Time
How can we map our feelings over time? How do various events impact our feelings, attitudes, and thoughts over the course of a year, or more? Can we effectively monitor our health behavior and choices and identify how they impact our mental and physical health? Can we assess employeesâ€™ satisfaction in their jobs over time or student retention, attention, and learning over the course of a term? 

CBSC185: Data Trends Over Time exposed me and my peers to these types of questions through data analysis. Throughout the course, we developed key skills in R. This included organizing and managing data, creating data visualizations, conducting statistical analysis, and undergoing best practices in data handling, management, and reproducibility. Goals for the course included developing a deeper understanding of data science and statistical concepts and developing a preliminary understanding of what longitudinal data is. Additionally, we learned how and when to conduct various analyses. 

To achieve these goals, we had some outlines and objectives. First, we practiced and learned how to draw conclusions from various datasets. Secondly, it was important to further develop skills in presenting statistical findings both verbally and in written reports. Also, it was key to be an informed consumer of psychological findings in media and everyday life, especially the statistical and methodological information and conclusions drawn.
